Voltage_divider_calculator
Author: Krzysztof Sikora

This application is designed to calculate the resistor values from every E-series from E3 to E192 so that the output voltage of a voltage divider
built using those is the closest to the desired one.
This version uses graphical user interface designed in QT and therefore can be used in both Windows and Linux OS.

Input:

input voltage
output voltage
Output (for each series):

calculated output voltage
used resistor values
